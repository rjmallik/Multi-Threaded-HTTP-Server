This project involves building a **multi-threaded HTTP server** that combines features from previous projects, such as an HTTP server and thread-safe data structures, to create a high-performance system capable of serving multiple clients simultaneously. The server incorporates a thread-safe queue and reader-writer locks to manage concurrency, allowing multiple threads to process requests while maintaining a coherent and atomic order of operations. This ensures the server can handle high throughput without compromising the integrity of client interactions.

The multi-threaded design includes a **thread pool architecture** with one dispatcher thread and a configurable number of worker threads. The dispatcher listens for incoming client connections and assigns them to worker threads via a thread-safe queue. Worker threads then process HTTP requests concurrently, adhering to the HTTP/1.1 protocol and producing appropriate responses. This design enables efficient resource utilization and improved system throughput by allowing multiple requests to be handled in parallel.

To maintain consistency, the server generates an **audit log** that records the order in which requests are processed. Each log entry includes the HTTP method, URI, response status code, and a client-specified `RequestID` header (or `0` if absent). The audit log provides a total ordering of requests and ensures that responses are coherent with the recorded sequence. This linearization guarantees that the behavior of the multi-threaded server is indistinguishable from a single-threaded implementation from the perspective of an external observer.

Synchronization plays a critical role in ensuring the server operates correctly under concurrent access. The system uses locks, condition variables, and other synchronization primitives to prevent race conditions, data corruption, and deadlocks. Worker threads process requests efficiently, blocking only when necessary to preserve the atomicity and coherence of operations. The server also ensures efficient handling of edge cases, such as overlapping requests for the same resource, by synchronizing request processing when required.

This project emphasizes the principles of concurrency, synchronization, and systems design, providing hands-on experience with building scalable, multi-threaded applications. By combining robust concurrency mechanisms with a coherent and auditable order of operations, the server achieves high performance and reliability, demonstrating how modern systems manage concurrency to maximize hardware utilization and ensure correctness.
